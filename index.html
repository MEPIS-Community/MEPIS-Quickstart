<h1>The MEPIS 11 Desktop</h1>
<p>This quickstart document is designed to acquaint you with the basic operation of the MEPIS 11 desktop; see also the Users Manual (Section 3.4) and the MEPIS Wiki under "KDE4." </p>

<p>After logging into Mepis 11.0 you will see the KDE4 desktop. The default Desktop for Mepis is Folder View, meaning that the desktop shows the contents of the Desktop directory in your Home. The Folder View desktop comprises the following elements:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
<div align="left"><h2>#1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The KDE Panel:</h2>
<br />
<div align="center"><img src="snapshot2.png" alt="M11_panel" width="1000" height="27" /></div>
<p>By default, the panel on the KDE desktop contains L-R:</p>
<ul>  
<li>The <em>Main Menu</em> icon on the extreme left. Installed programs are automatically listed in the Main Menu in the appropriate category. To start a program, click on the Main Menu icon in the panel or press Alt + F1, select the desired category, then navigate to the program listing and click it.</li>
<li>The <em>Pager</em>, which provides access to virtual desktops (see #9 below)</li>
<li><em>Quick launch</em> program icons.</li> 
<ul>
<li><em>System Settings</em> (see #7 below)</li>
<li><em>Dolphin</em> (File Manager) (see #10) below </li>
<li><em>Firefox</em> (Browser)   </li>
<li><em>Kmail</em> (Mail Client) </li>
</ul>
<li>In the middle, the <em>Taskbar</em> shows currently open windows. In this case, the <em>Quickstart </em> manual which you are now viewing.</li>
<li>On the right, the <em>System Tray </em> holds installed essential processes:</li>
<ul><li>Information</li>
<li>Upgrade notifier</li>
<li>Clipboard</li>
<li>Sound mixer</li>
<li>Network manager</li>
<li>Hidden icons</li>
<li>Clock/calendar</li>
<li>The panel settings icon ("cashew") is on the extreme right. </li> 
</ul></ul>
<p>When you hover the mouse pointer over an icon in the panel, a short description is displayed.</p>
<p>To better understand the underlying capabilities of the KDE4 panel icons, click on <em>Main Menu</em> at the bottom of your screen to explore its options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
</div>




 
<h2 id="no2">#2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desktop Context Menu</h2>
<img class="fr" src="./grafx/desktop-context.png" width="270" height="293">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Right-click in an empty area of the desktop to access the context menu for configuring the appearance of the desktop, adding panels or widgets to the desktop, configuring desktop settings, locking the widgets in their current position, leaving the current session, or for locking the current screen.</p>
<p>Remember that <strong>Locking Widgets</strong> prevents you from messing up anything. <strong>Unlock Widgets</strong> to add or move elements, then <strong>Lock Widgets</strong> again to protect your configuration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



<h2 id="no3">#3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desktop Tool box, “The Cashew”:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>


<img class="fl" src="./grafx/dsktp-toolbox-1.png" width="229" height="172">


<p>Move your mouse pointer to the top right hand corner of the desktop and click “the cashew” to access its menu. Desktop elements can be locked in their current position on the desktop to prevent them being moved around or accidentally being deleted. As long as the desktop elements are locked you cannot add, move or remove any objects from the desktop.  To lock or unlock the desktop, right-click an empty patch on the desktop or the cashew icon (desktop toolbox) at the top right corner and select <strong>Lock Widgets</strong> or <strong>Unlock Widgets</strong>.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2 id="no4">#4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Run Command:</h2>

<img class="fr" src="./grafx/krun-1.png" width="420" height="267">

<p>KRunner is a helper application that lets you quickly start programs, It also offers a search function for finding applications or locations.</p>
<p>Press Alt + F2 to open the <strong>Run command</strong> dialog, or right-click anywhere on the desktop and choose <strong>Run command.</strong></p>


<p>Type a command —for example, “dolphin”. While you are typing, the dialog shows a list of  applications or actions that match your input. Select one of the results, or press <strong>enter</strong> to launch the highlighted application or action.</p>

<p>The command to start the application is often ( but not always) the application name written in lowercase.
KRunner's abilities can also be extended by a number of plug-ins that provide additional functionality. </p>
<p>Consult the Users Manual for details.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



<h2 id="no5">#5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual Desktop Elements:</h2>

<p>In the following section you will find some examples of how to change individual desktop elements:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>




<h2 id="no6">#6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desktop Background</h2>

<p>Right-click an empty patch of the desktop and select <strong>Folder View Settings.</strong> A configuration dialog appears.</p>
<img class="fr" src="./grafx/plasma-wkspc-1.png" width="500" height="250">



<p>In the Wallpaper section, choose from the Type drop-down list what you want as desktop background. The further configuration options depend on the choice of object to use as background.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>


<h2 id="no7">#7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System Settings</h2>

<p>System Settings is the central place for users to change the overall appearance and behaviour of many components of the KDE desktop.   Launch it with the panel icon or from <strong>Main Menu &gt; Settings &gt; System Settings</strong>. To get an impression of the numerous possibilities, click on a category icon and explore the options.  Performing tasks in some areas of System Settings requires the root password.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>


<h2 id="no8">#8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desktop Effects</h2>
<p>If your computer supports a 3D graphic card with the correct driver installed, you can use graphical effects like turning your desktop into a rotating 3D cube, you can also use other window effects such as shadows, fading, and transformations.  If you do not have a 3D graphic card or the correct driver is not installed, the desktop effects will be disabled.</p>
<p>If the performance of your computer is slow or jerky, disable the compositing effects  in the current session with <strong>Alt + Shift + F12</strong>.</p>

<h3>To configure effects on your desktop:</h3>
<p>Start <strong>System Settings &gt; Select Desktop &gt; Desktop Effects</strong>, and choose <strong>Enable Desktop Effects</strong>, if you graphic card does not support 3D or the correct driver is not installed, you will be notified.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>


<h2 id="no9">#9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual Desktops</h2>

<p>The desktop environment allows you to organize your programs and tasks on several virtual desktops (4 by default). If you often run a lot of programs simultaneously, this minimizes the number of windows to arrange on your screen. You might for example, use  desktop #1 for web browsing, #2 for word processing and #3 for graphics applications.</p>
<img class="fr" src="./grafx/virt-desktops-1.png" width="515" height="477">

<p>With KDE 4, Dolphin has replaced Konqueror as the default file manager. To start Dolphin, click on the “file cabinet” icon in the panel, or press Alt + F2 and type in <em>dolphin</em>.</p>

<h3>Main Window</h3>
<ul>
<li>Menu Bar: The menu bar holds menu items for actions like copying, moving, or deleting files, changing views, starting additional tools, defining your settings, and getting help.</li>

<li>Toolbar: the toolbar provides provides quick access to frequently used functions that can also be accessed via the menu, if you hover the mouse cursor over an icon, a short description is displayed.</li>

It is available in 2 versions: one shows the path to the current directory with icons for every parent folder in a “bread crumb” view. Click on any icon in the bread crumb view to change to that directory. The second version of the location bar shows the path to the current  directory as a string of text that you can edit.</li>
 
<li>Panels: By default dolphin shows the Places and information panel. The Places panel allows quick access to some often used  places like your home directory, the root directory of the file system (/) and removable media. The information shows detailed information about the selected item, and allows  ratings, tags or comments to it. There are several other panels which can be added to the main window.</li>

<li>Display Field (Working Space):  The display field shows the contents of the selected directory or file. By default Dolphin displays  the contents of your home directory on start-up.

<li>Status Bar: Shows the file type and size of the currently selected object and allows you to enlarge or diminish the size of the icons or entries in the display field.</li>
</ul>
